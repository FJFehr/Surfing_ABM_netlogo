Project: Create an agent based model to solve problem of your interest

This is repo contains a Netlogo Agent Based Model (ABM) for modeling the fatigue temperature trade off for surfing in the atlantic oceans of South Africa. This is followed by a Rmarkdown report of results.

Problem statement: South Africa has produced world famous surfers despite the conditions being extremely challenging. There is a tiredness vs cold trade off that affects the the duration of each session. This is dependent on factors such as; Number of waves caught, number of duckdives, time spent waiting for waves, wave conditions etc. 

The question is simple: What are the conditions that result in surfers being able to spend long durations surfing?
